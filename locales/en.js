		stxp1: "The CRC competition is truly one of the greatest opportunities for our team. Last year was the first year coming back to CRC and with no experience, we were still able to get a great standing, build bonds with other schools, and obtain more knowledge on what to prepare as well as how to prepare for the upcoming year. ",
		stxp2: "Last year we struggled a lot with organization, so this year we took it into consideration. We made teams and subteams so that we could accomplish more efficiently. However, we accepted too many people into the team and could not keep track of who was where and doing what. So as a result there were some conflicts as to who should go where based on their skill set but we pulled through together. Now we've accomplished a stable flow and everything is going smoothly. ",
		stxp3: "One of the many learning values was understanding the role of being a leader. We all cooperatively managed to delegate tasks and keep our teams in order. ",
		stxp4: "The amazing part of the robotic team is that it mainly consists of graduates, therefore we can create many unforgettable memories. The race for the snacks in the robot room, the old half-broken radio keeping the kiosk team company as they paint, and the programming team having ‚Äúthe time of their lives‚Äù debugging their work",
		stxp5: "Many model balls were used to play aggressive catch and many hairs were pulled from stress. Not to forget to mention the ginormous eye bags that most people have. Lots of time was sacrificed and many study hours turned into robot-building or kiosk-painting sessions resulting in poor marks in exams. Also, countless days I should be spending outside with our friends but am continuously working on the elements that require submission DURING OUR BREAK. Tears did not only shed, they gushed."

			dec: "After rebuilding the kiosk, we began sketching. We completed half of it before the break. We also planned the colors to be used.",
			jan: "We finished the sketch during this month. However, we couldn't start painting immediately because we lacked paint. Eventually, we painted the pink land and the base of the sky.",
			feb: "In February, we painted mountains and lakes, which were made out of chocolate, and added intricate details to them."

			jan: "In January we received the costumes.",
			feb: "Filming went smoothly. On Monday, Samir, George and Uzma started to film part 2 of the movie since Uzma had to leave for Bangladesh. We had a lot of fun filming this part of the movie. We had to do a lot of retakes because we were laughing a lot and we had people from the school interrupting us. In the last week of February Samir and George went all around Montreal filming in different places. We went to Saint Joseph's Oratory of Mount Royal, the tip of the Montreal island and filmed on the water. We took many different shots that will make the video look cool. We 3D printed props for the movie and we started filming the last parts of the movie and the editing started.",
			mar: "In March the team finished the video. We had to put together the video and edit the footage we had to make it all come together. We also got final shots of our main character, Ralph, played by George, working on our robot. It was actually quite challenging, with the dead-line looming over us."

			aug: "In August, significant updates were made to the website. We transitioned to an arcade-style theme, complete with a CRT screen effect, and introduced a color scheme predominantly comprised of black and blue. The addition of a pixelated font enhanced the retro aesthetic. Practical improvements included the incorporation of a readme file and adjustments to the font selection. Additionally, a .gitignore file was implemented to streamline version control processes.",
			oct: "In October, our efforts focused on enhancing the website's organization and visual appeal. We implemented a systematic approach, ensuring that every page served a distinct purpose. Transitioning from the previous arcade theme, we embraced a more vibrant candy aesthetic, unifying the color and theme across all pages for a cohesive experience. We added dark/light modes because dark mode is awesome. Adding a fade-out transition between pages elevated the overall user experience, providing a seamless browsing journey. Additionally, we dedicated time to polishing existing features, refining elements such as headers, theme switchers, transitions, and image spacing and sizing. Yanni introduced a scoring feature, awarding 2 points per click and 10 points per link, enhancing user engagement. However, the theme switcher encountered issues, requiring extensive troubleshooting for the remainder of the month. Despite this setback, our commitment to quality and functionality remained unwavering as we worked diligently to resolve the issue and ensure a smooth user experience.",
			nov: "In November, our focus shifted towards refining the website's functionality and appearance. Addressing formatting issues, we improved the overall aesthetic appeal. Translation problems were resolved, including the removal of duplicate files associated with the French version. We also implemented automatic language detection based on system preferences. Theme switcher issues were rectified, enhancing user experience consistency. Julian recommended adding manual language change options, providing users with more control. Additionally, we streamlined the homepage and extended its features to other pages for uniformity. This involved adjustments to headers, theme switchers, and language options across the site. To optimize mobile browsing, we introduced a hamburger menu for smaller screens, ensuring ease of navigation on phones. These updates reflect our commitment to delivering a seamless and user-friendly website experience.",
			dec: "In December, our focus shifted towards setting up the roster section of the website. We introduced boxes displaying both people's names and faces, although descriptions were not yet included. Initially attempting to make the boxes clickable for additional information, we encountered difficulties, prompting us to make them hoverable instead. Despite these efforts, the functionality remained peculiar, and challenges persisted in achieving the desired interaction. We acknowledge the current state of the roster section and continue to explore solutions for improvement."

			sep: "We tried out different wheels and bases to find the best fit for our pilot. This took some time since we had to think about whether we wanted ease of use or degrees of motion.",
			oct: "We decided to use last year‚Äôs base for the robot. Since this is our second year, knowing what we know now, we were able to make the right changes quicker and we knew what to prioritize and what to discard.",
			nov: "Kickoff!!! The Kickoff was great and we excitedly began planning and brainstorming ideas. After the initial brainstorming was complete we ordered parts and prepared for assembly.",
			dec: "In December is when we started building. The first prototypes we made were rough but after a bit of trial and error we got to a good design for the base.",
			jan: "This is when we started work on the ball pick-up mechanisms. We went through three prototypes before finally landing on the right one. In the meantime we were also working on shooting mechanisms.",
			feb: "As well as some finishing touches, everything is now assembled and (almost) ready to go. All we have to do now is fix up our wiring."

Secondly, build and decorate a kiosk encompassing the team's chosen theme. Thirdly, we filmed and edited a video to create a narrative correlating with the selected theme and explain the game and other important information. Lastly and most importantly, the programming. We are required to develop a websiteüéÄ and program the robot. Additionally, if any mini-games are included in the kiosk, the program team is usually in charge.",
		game3:  "All these elements must be accomplished before submission; the only exception is the competition. Every year, a new game is provided to all the teams on the day of the kickoff, and on the day of the competition, each team is required to follow the rules and regulations of that particular game.",

		game5:  "The goal is simple: get as many possible points for your team. There is a blue and yellow team, each with two robots that will interchange through the competition. The game is played on the playing field represented below:",
		game6:  "The robots start in the designated area outlined by the color assigned and are controlled by the pilots and directed by the co-pilots of the team.  They must stay within their side or the neutral area indicated by the red area in the middle where the game pieces will be placed at the beginning. The teams must stay within the red zone after the balls are retrieved at the start of the game.",
		game7:  "On each side of the playing field, there will be 2 of the following targets:",
		game8:  "There will be one tall target on the back of each side and one short target on the side with each team‚Äôs color. The goal is to get the game pieces into the targets or on the multiplayer and get as many points as possible for your team.",
		game9:  "There are also three multipliers on both sides. These poles of various sizes are scattered around the field, and depending on how many game pieces you put on the pole, your score multiplies.",
		game10: "All the teams playing must be identified with their color and number before the games.",
		game11: "The referee has full authority and can make any judgment about the game. For example, if a piece of a robot drops and obstructs other players from continuing, if a robot is damaging the playing field or game piece, prevent robots from violating the air space on the edges of the playing field and make sure the scoring is accurate.",
